# FastFFT

## Broad strokes

This project aims to accelerate a specific set of FFTs important for cryo-Electron Microscopy. It does so by taking advantage of the cufftdx library from Nvidia, currently in early access as well as algorithmic ideas from *Sorensen et. al* [[1]](#1). An additional experimental aspect is the development of the scientific manuscript "live" alongside the development of the code.
